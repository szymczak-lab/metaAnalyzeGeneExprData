Description: Integrate results of multiple gene expression data sets using 
    statistical meta-analysis approaches. The package contains functionality to 
    run differential expression analysis for each study, perform quality 
    control of the study-level results and summarize results using fixed and 
    random effects meta-analysis including estimation of gene and study level 
    heterogeneity.
