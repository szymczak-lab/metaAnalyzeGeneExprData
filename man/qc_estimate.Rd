\title{QC on estimates}
\usage{
qc_estimate(res.studies)
}
\arguments{
\item{res.studies}{[list] study specific
results (as generated by \code{\link{load_study_results}}.}
}
\value{
data.frame with gene level statistics for each study:
\itemize{
\item id = unique study identifier
\item median.cor.estimate = median number of correlation of estimates with
other studies
\item median.cor.estimate.outlier = outlier based on
median.cor.estimate (1: yes, 0: no, NA: not calculated due to small
number of studies)
}
}
\description{
Calculate correlation of estimates in each pair of studies
based on overlapping genes.
